# Nobel Prize Data Analysis Project
## Overview
The Nobel Prize, established in 1901, is one of the most esteemed international accolades, recognizing outstanding contributions to humanity across various disciplines, including chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. Each recipient not only earns a prestigious gold medal bearing the image of Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) but also gains worldwide recognition and substantial prize money.

For this project, I analyzed a dataset from the Nobel Prize API, which includes information about all laureates from 1901 to 2023. By diving into this rich dataset, I sought to uncover interesting patterns and insights into the history of Nobel Prize winners.

Key Questions Explored
Through my analysis, I sought to answer several key questions, including:

### What are the most common attributes of Nobel laureates?

Examining attributes such as gender, country of birth, and category of award.
Which decade or category saw notable changes in gender representation?

Investigating trends in the increasing or decreasing representation of women in various categories.
Who are the repeat winners, and what makes their contributions unique?

Analyzing those who have won more than once and the significance of their groundbreaking work.
How has the representation of US-born laureates evolved over time?

Exploring trends in the number of US laureates and comparing this with other countries.
Methodology
In this project, I used various data analysis techniques to explore and visualize the dataset, including:

### Data cleaning and preprocessing
Statistical analysis
Data visualization using charts and graphs
Trend analysis across decades
The dataset includes detailed information about the Nobel laureates, including their name, country, year of award, category, and gender. By analyzing this data, I aimed to provide insights that reflect the evolution of the Nobel Prize and its global impact.

### Visualizations
The analysis is accompanied by interactive visualizations that help answer the above questions. Key visualizations include:

Gender distribution of laureates over time
Age distribution of Nobel Prize winners
Proportion of laureates by category and country
These visualizations offer a clear picture of how different factors have changed over time and allow for easy exploration of trends in the Nobel Prize’s history.

### Conclusion
This project not only showcases the findings from my exploration but also serves as an example of how data analysis techniques can be used to answer complex historical and societal questions. The project is structured to encourage further exploration of this fascinating dataset.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and results in my GitHub repository. I’m open to feedback and suggestions, and I hope this project inspires more data enthusiasts to explore historical datasets like this one!
